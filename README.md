# Isolate-Analysis
Isolate Analysis for the course mimg 109AL. Please notify us if you have any questions or problems. 

## Running Example Data:
1. Go to https://mybinder.org/, type in the URL of this github repository https://github.com/keithgmitchell/Isolate-Analysis  under "GitHub repository name or URL", and click Launch.
2. Open the analysis notebook (.ipynb) and the select *Run>Run All Cells*. This will run the notebook with the example data provided.

## Analysis with your own data:
3. Save your excel Isolate Spreadsheet as a `.csv ` file and then upload it to the Jupyter notebook by selecting *File>Open...*. It is suggested to view the `.csv` file in Excel and be sure the column labels are similar to the example file.  
4. Replace `file_name = "109AL-F18_IsolateSpreadsheet.csv"` with the name of your file. 
5. The example analysis only takes into account the cellulase data as you will see in the last couple of cells under the **Functional Assay Sample Analysis** category. Copy and paste the two cells (the statistic and the graph creation). Now change the `Cellulase Production (radius in mm) Average` to the category from the spreadsheet that you care about.
