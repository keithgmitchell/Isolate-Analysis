4. Replace `file_name = "109AL-F18_IsolateSpreadsheet.csv"` with the name of your file. 
5. The example analysis only takes into account the cellulase data as you will see in the last couple of cells under the **Functional Assay Sample Analysis** category. Copy and paste the two cells (the statistic and the graph creation). Now change the `Cellulase Production (radius in mm) Average` to the category from the spreadsheet that you care about.
